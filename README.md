python -m http.server 8000
```

Open: http://localhost:8000

## Publish as a real public link (GitHub Pages)
1. Create a GitHub repo (public).
2. Upload all files in this folder (keep folder structure).
3. Settings → Pages:
   - Source: Deploy from a branch
   - Branch: `main` / `(root)`
4. Wait for the Pages URL to appear (it will look like `https://<user>.github.io/<repo>/`).
